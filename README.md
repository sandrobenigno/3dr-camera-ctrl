This firmware is part of the ArduCAM OSD Project: an open source Arduino based OSD and Camera Control.

<pre>
Author(s): Sandro Benigno
           Legacy PTP commands from Canon's PS-ReCSDK 1.1.0e
           Custom extended PTP commands from CHDK's PTP implementation
           USB host and PTP library from Oleg Mazurov - circuitsathome.com

Note: The PTP library used here was modified by the author.
      There are special characteristics needed to cover the scripting approach.
      The CHDK PTP Transaction has a wider RX buffer (reflected on the dataSize flag).
